# Data Physicalization
Research articles, links, and other resources to support data physicalization

## Build background knowledge
* Start with the [Data Physicalization Wiki](http://dataphys.org/wiki/Data_Physicalization) for an overview.

## Toolkits and workshop materials
* Shannon Mattern and Jonas Voigt have posted their materials for an [Urban Intelligence workshop](http://www.wordsinspace.net/urbanintel/spring2018/portfolio/march-14-observing-operationalizing-spatial-intelligences-ii-illustrations-interfaces-kits-guides/), including illustrations, interfaces, kits and guides. 
* Materials from the [Considering Physical Variables for Data Physicalization Workshop](https://data-physicalisation.github.io/).
* Visualising Information for Advocacy is a [book about how advocates and activists use visual elements in their campaigns](https://visualisingadvocacy.org/). This 160-page guide features nearly 50 case studies from around the world to provide an introduction to understanding visual information and a framework for using images for influence.
* Check out [Citizen Sensing: A Toolkit](https://making-sense.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Citizen-Sensing-A-Toolkit.pdf) from Making Sense. "Citizen sensing is often inspired by concern over a critical problem. The first step is to identify the concerns of those in the community and develop an understanding of the issue. This is a collaborative process that informs and guides community action, and helps build a shared position around an issue." You may also be interested in their report on [Co-Desgining Participatory Approaches for Communities](http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC110752/jrc110752_makingsense_d42_co-designingparticipatoryapproachesforcommunities.pdf).

## Projects and examples
* David Hunterâ€™s [Data Walking](http://www.corruptedfiles.org.uk/portfolio/data-walking/) research project aims to collect environmental data while walking around North Greenwich, to build a rich picture of that area over time. Data gathering devices include sensors on micro controllers, smart phones, and recorded notes. This data is then used to create maps, charts, data experiences, or artistic works by participants to represent the area and the process of the project.
* Check out a community-based example from Barcelona and consider the reasons wy [Smart Cities Need Thick Data, Not Big Data](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Smith15/publication/326849902_Smart_cities_need_thick_data_not_big_data/links/5b8651bd92851c1e12390bb0/Smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data.pdf?origin=publication_detail). 
* Visit Trevor Hogan's site on [Tactile Data](http://tactiledata.net/) to see a variety of data physicalization ideas in action.
