# Data Physicalization
Research articles, links, and other resources to support data physicalization


## Projects and resources
* Start with the [Data Physicalization Wiki](http://dataphys.org/wiki/Data_Physicalization) for an overview of these ideas.
* David Hunter’s [Data Walking](http://www.corruptedfiles.org.uk/portfolio/data-walking/) research project aims to collect environmental data while walking around North Greenwich, to build a rich picture of that area over time. Data gathering devices include sensors on micro controllers, smart phones, and recorded notes. This data is then used to create maps, charts, data experiences, or artistic works by participants to represent the area and the process of the project.
* Materials from the [Considering Physical Variables for Data Physicalization Workshop](https://data-physicalisation.github.io/). 
* Visit Trevor Hogan's site on [Tactile Data](http://tactiledata.net/)
* Shannon Mattern and Jonas Voigt have posted their materials for an [Urban Intelligence workshop](http://www.wordsinspace.net/urbanintel/spring2018/portfolio/march-14-observing-operationalizing-spatial-intelligences-ii-illustrations-interfaces-kits-guides/), including illustrations, interfaces, kits and guides.
